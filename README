*==================*
* Program Function *
*==================*

Read xml file to load a search tree and traverse it using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta prunning.
XML file contains only "Node" Elements with a value property. The value is a stand in for a game state heuristic.
XML is temporary, next iterations will use the game to create a search tree.

Minimax code is included in minimax.cpp and minimax.h
XML-related code is included in readxml.cpp and readxml.h; it uses the libxml2 libraries (http://xmlsoft.org/).

The program has been tested under i686 GNU/Linux with the 3.6.2 Linux kernel as well as under Windows using cygwin.

* Unpacking and Compiling instructions  *
*=======================================*

Under Linux or cygwin:
(You must have the libxml2 dev libraries installed)
    untar:
        # tar xfvj magcave-1.tar.bz2
    compile using make:
        # make
    or compile manually:
        # g++ magcave.cpp minimax.cpp readxml.cpp -I/usr/include/libxml2 -lxml2 -o magcave

*=======================*
* Running instructions  *
*=======================*

Under Linux or cygwin:
    # ./magcave [<depth>]
where [<depth>] is an optional depth, defaults to 5
